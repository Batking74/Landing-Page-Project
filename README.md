# Landing Page Project 1

### Description
Crafted during my sophomore year of high school in 2021, at the age of 15 or 16, amid the COVID pandemic, this project served as a dedicated platform for advancing my problem-solving skills. The objective was to translate a given design into code, relying solely on visual analysis and breaking down the structure into manageable components. Additionally, this initiative became a valuable learning ground for mastering the art of responsive design. Through consistent practice, I honed the ability to ensure that the project maintained functionality and aesthetic appeal across various devices and screen sizes. This dual focus on problem-solving and responsiveness reflects my commitment to holistic web development skills.

- I was motivated to build this project because I wanted to further my problem solving skills by challenging myself to build a design from scratch.
- I love projects like these because I naturally love to look at designs and try to build them from scratch. I love the challenge, and the analytical process/thinking my brain goes through when solving problems like these.
- This Project also helped me further my Responsive Web Design Skills using Media Queries
